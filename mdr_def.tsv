C1869006	Torsade de pointes (TdP) is a form of rapid ventricular tachycardia which can be hereditary or acquired. In some acquired forms, there appear to be genetic predispositions related to sub-clinical potassium channel abnormalities. On electrocardiogram (ECG),TdP is associated with or preceded by polymorphic QRS complexes; other ECG changes include prolonged QT or QTc interval, prominent U waves, T wave alternans or bizarre T wave aberrations, and long-short sequences. TdP can resolve spontaneously, but acquired forms often recur until the underlying cause is corrected, and can progress to ventricular fibrillation. Clinical manifestations include palpitations, dizziness, syncope, and, rarely, sudden death.
C1869007	Myopathy is a disorder of striated muscle, with or without changes in muscle mass, and may be accompanied by muscle pain or tenderness. Rhabdomyolysis results from extensive necrosis of skeletal muscle with release of muscle contents and can be related to hereditary metabolic or structural abnormalities effecting skeletal muscle cells or non-hereditary causes such as (e.g., trauma). Muscle signs and symptoms include pain, weakness, tenderness, and contractures, weight gain, fatigue, malaise, fever, nausea, tachycardia, and dark urine. Potentially serious sequelae include acute renal failure, compartment syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, cardiomyopathy, and respiratory failure.
C1869008	Acute renal failure (ARF) is characterized by a relatively rapid decline in renal function that leads to the accumulation of water, crystalloid solutes, and nitrogenous metabolites in the body. Other clinical features include: increase in serum creatinine and urea nitrogen levels (azotemia) greater than 0.5 and 10 mg per deciliter, respectively; oliguria; and changes in the rate of urine flow. ARF may present with a de novo onset in individuals whose baseline renal function was within normal limits. Additionally, ARF may consist of acute exacerbation of pre-existing chronic renal insufficiency.

C1869023	Hemolytic anemia is characterized by premature destruction of red blood cells and compensatory erythroid hyperplasia. Additional features include increased reticulocyte values, increased unconjugated serum bilirubin and decreased (or absent) serum haptoglobin. Causes can be grouped as follows: due to internal abnormalities of red blood cells (e.g., enzyme defects, hemoglobinopathies); abnormalities of the red cell membrane (e.g., hereditary spherocytosis, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, spur cell anemia); and extrinsic factors (e.g., splenomegaly, drug-induced antibodies, microangiopathic hemolysis, infections, toxins).
C1869024	This SMQ was developed to identify cases of severe, sometimes life-threatening skin reactions that are often drug-induced. Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) include: Erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis.
C1869025	Drug-induced pancreatitis is usually an acute condition. If clinically suspected, it should always be confirmed by biochemical investigations - Definition of acute pancreatitis: o An inflammatory disease of the pancreas characterized by upper abdominal pain and vomiting; in severe cases - abdominal guarding, rigidity, rebound tenderness and diminution or loss of bowel sounds o Almost always accompanied by increased pancreatic enzymes - amylase and lipase - in the blood and urine o Other signs/findings are icterus, increased alkaline phosphatase and/or bilirubin, ileus, ascites, hyperglycemia, hypocalcemia and leukocytosis o Cullen's sign is sometimes associated with severe necrotizing pancreatitis - Severe attacks may lead to shock with renal and pulmonary insufficiency, which may be fatal.
C1869026	Agranulocytosis can occur as a reaction to a wide variety of toxic agents (including drugs - Life-threatening due to increased susceptibility to infection - Overall annual incidence less than 1:100,000 in the general population - Severe neutropenia (< 0.5 x 109/l of circulating granulocytes) associated with the sudden onset of signs and symptoms of bacterial infection o fever, malaise and prostration o oropharyngeal or anorectal lesions

C1869028	Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which mast cells, eosinophils and T lymphocytes play a role. The inflammation causes an increased airway responsiveness to a variety of stimuli leading to bronchospasm/ bronchoconstriction. Clinically, asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and cough. Characteristic of these episodes is variable airflow limitation; this may resolve or partly reversed either spontaneously or with treatment. Bronchospasm/bronchoconstriction is defined as airflow limitation due to contraction of bronchial smooth muscle; an improvement in airflow in response to bronchodilators is essential for the diagnosis. Bronchospasm, along with airway inflammation, is a contributing factor to airway limitation in asthmatics. Aggravated bronchospasm/bronchoconstriction and paradoxical bronchospasm are terms used to describe an unexpected episode of bronchospasm related to inhalation aerosol treatment; its causes can be either the inhalation procedure or irritation due to the aerosol (active or inactive ingredients).
C1869029	Altered, most often excessive, concentration of lipids in blood - Result of a genetic predisposition, secondary causes, or of a combination of both- Three forms: o Hypercholesterolemia o Hypertriglyceridemia o Mixed forms - Cholesterol-carrying lipoproteins are differentiated on the basis of their buoyant properties as LDL, VLDL, and HDL and may vary on the amount of cholesterol present in each particle, in the number of circulating particles, or both - Hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia per se do not produce specific symptoms, unless associated with the disease of an organ involved in the metabolism of lipid (e.g., pancreatitis) - Some clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis occur after decades of silent onset and progression of lesions - Acute hypercholesterolemia is not known to occur as adverse response to drug - Acute hypertriglyceridaemia may be the expression of excessive (binge-like) consumption of fat-rich foods or alcohol, or it may relate to diabetes - especially when not properly controlled - or pancreatitis.

C1869043	Diagnosis based on elevated levels of fasting plasma glucose or random plasma glucose plus symptoms. Hyperglycemia in diabetes mellitus (DM) occurs as a result of reduced insulin secretion, decreased glucose usage, or increased glucose production. Type I DM: About 10% of all cases; Insulin deficiency resulting from autoimmune beta cell destruction (type IA) or idiopathic (type IB). Type II DM: About 90% of all cases; Heterogeneous disorder of glucose metabolism characterized by variable degrees of insulin resistance, impaired insulin secretion, and increased hepatic glucose production. Drugs have been associated with hyperglycemia that can progress to new onset DM: Can mimic type I or II; Mechanisms: Diminished insulin production, inhibited insulin secretion, and reduced beta cell volume (e.g., cyclosporine); Autoimmune destruction of beta cells and increased insulin antibody titers (e.g., interleukin-2); Hormone stimulated gluconeogenesis and decreased insulin sensitivity (e.g., glucocorticosteroids); Decreased insulin sensitivity (e.g. protease inhibitors); Often reversible by discontinuation of drug, or can be controlled with oral antidiabetic agents and/or insulin. Common findings/symptoms: polydipsia, polyphagia, polyuria, weight loss, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. Acute complications: Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) particularly type I; Nonketotic hyperosmolar state (NKHS) particularly type II diabetes; Both can result in neurologic symptoms including coma. Long term complications are microvascular (e.g., retinopathy), macrovascular (e.g., coronary artery disease), neuropathic (e.g., paresthesias).
C1869044	Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are a heterogeneous group of conditions that involve the alveolar walls and perialveolar tissue. The ILDs are nonmalignant and are not caused by any defined infectious agents. Approximately 180 known individual diseases are characterized by interstitial lung involvement, either as primary disease or as a significant part of a multiorgan process, as occurs in collagen vascular diseases. The initial response is inflammation in the air spaces and alveolar walls. If the disease is chronic, inflammation spreads to adjacent portions of the interstitium and vasculature and eventually produces interstitial fibrosis. Scarring and distortion of lung tissue leads to significant derangement of gas exchange and ventilatory function. One approach to classification is to separate ILDs into two groups based on 1) known causes or 2) unknown causes. Each group can be further subdivided based on the presence or absence of granulomas.

C1869075	A seizure is a paroxysmal event due to abnormal, excessive, hypersynchronous discharges from an aggregate of central nervous system (CNS) neurons. Manifestations range from dramatic convulsive activity to experiential phenomena not readily discernible by an observer. Epilepsy should be distinguished from seizure. Epilepsy is a condition with recurrent seizures due to a chronic, underlying process. Epilepsy is not a single disease entity and there are various epilepsy syndromes. Convulsions are the motor component of cerebral seizures. Convulsions are characterized by contractions of skeletal muscles, appearing abruptly and involuntarily. These contractions may be tonic or clonic and they may be focal or generalized. International Classification of Epileptic Seizures (1981): 1. Partial seizures a. Simple partial seizures (with motor, sensory, autonomic, or psychic signs) b. Complex partial seizures c. Partial seizures with secondary generalization 2. Primarily generalized seizures a. Absence (petit mal) b. Tonic clonic (grand mal) c. Tonic d. Atonic e. Myoclonic 3. Unclassified seizures a. Neonatal seizure b. Infantile spasms
C1869076	Pseudomembranous colitis is a severe, necrotizing process that involves the large intestine and occurs as a complication of antibiotic therapy. It occasionally occurs in the absence of antibiotic exposure; a predisposing condition is often present, e.g., recent bowel surgery, uraemia, intestinal ischaemia, chemotherapy, bone marrow transplantation. The responsible pathogen is Clostridium difficile, a member of the normal flora that overgrows in the presence of certain antibiotics or in the absence of normal bacterial flora due to other factors. Culture and toxin tests are available to identify C. difficile but a positive microbiology test(s) in the absence of clinical findings does not support a definitive diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis. Many reports of diarrhoea associated with antibiotic therapy may not have definitive diagnoses or specific tests for pseudomembranous colitis. Uncomplicated antibiotic-induced diarrhoea usually subsides spontaneously within two weeks of antibiotic discontinuation. For persisting symptoms or frank colitis, aggressive therapy may be required to restore balance of the bacterial flora within the lumen of the intestinal tract.
C1869077	Thrombotic disorders are diseases characterized by formation of a thrombus that obstructs vascular blood flow locally or detaches and embolizes to occlude blood flow downstream. Embolism is the sudden blocking of a vessel by a clot or foreign material which has been brought to its site of lodgement by the blood current. (Thrombo-)phlebitis is an inflammation of a vein (phlebitis) associated with thrombus formation (thrombosis).

C1963985	Acute central respiratory depression is a form of respiratory failure. Respiratory failure is defined as impairment of gas exchange between ambient air and circulating blood: problems in intrapulmonary gas exchange lead to hypoxemia and problems in the movement of gases cause hypercapnia. Depression of the respiratory center with resulting respiratory acidosis may occur: acutely with general anesthetics, sedatives, and head trauma, or chronically with sedatives, alcohol, intracranial tumors, and syndromes of sleep-disordered breathing, including the primary alveolar and obesity-hypoventilation syndromes. Acute hypoxemia may cause cardiac arrhythmia and coma. Alteration of consciousness is typical, confusion is common. Acute hypercapnia may cause: subtle personality changes and headache through to marked confusion and narcosis, cerebral vasodilation and increased CSF pressure, acidemia which, when severe, contributes to pulmonary arteriolar vasoconstriction, systemic vascular dilation, reduced myocardial contractility, hyperkalemia, hypotension, and cardiac irritability. Central respiratory depression mainly occurs in neonates of prematurity or in sleep apnea. Apnea of prematurity may be caused by CNS immaturity (central) or airway obstruction. Central sleep apnea (CSA) has two categories: 1. Hypercapnia with decreased ventilatory drive or a decreased ability to breathe. 2. Eucapnia or hypocapnia with increased ventilatory drive but sleep-induced apnea and periodic breathing. Cheyne-Stokes breathing is a discrete pattern of this form of CSA that may be seen in opiate associated respiratory depression.
C1963986	Psychosis refers to a mental disorder characterized by gross impairment in reality testing evidenced by: delusions, hallucinations, markedly incoherent speech, disorganized and agitated behavior, usually without apparent awareness on the patient's part. Psychosis is also used in a more general sense to refer to mental disorders in which mental functioning is sufficiently impaired as to interfere grossly with patient's capacity to meet the ordinary demands of life. Psychosis can be caused by many psychiatric disorders such as: schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, brief psychotic reaction, mania with psychosis, depression with psychosis, dementia, and delirium. Psychosis is also associated with: certain illicit drugs (cocaine, amphetamine, etc.) and medications (dopamine agonists, l-dopa, psychostimulants, etc.). In schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and brief psychotic disorder, the term psychotic refers to delusions, any prominent hallucinations, disorganized speech or disorganized or catatonic behavior.

C1963999	The Fifth World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension, 2013, established a new classification of pulmonary hypertension (PH), and a new definition was released in 2015, which impacted the case identification parameters for Pulmonary hypertension (SMQ). A decision was therefore made to revise Pulmonary hypertension (SMQ). A new definition and new inclusion/exclusion criteria were established, based upon the conclusions of the Fifth World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension, and of The Joint Task Force for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Pulmonary Hypertension of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS). The updated term list was subjected to testing. PH has previously been defined as a resting mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) > 25 mm Hg, or an mPAP with exercise > 30 mm Hg. The subgroup of PH known as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) adds the criterion that the pulmonary arterial wedge pressure must be <= 15 mm Hg. Some definitions have also included pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), requiring that it be >= 2 or 3 Wood units. Potential weaknesses of the previous definition are that the level, type, and posture of exercise had not been specified. Furthermore, the normal exercise pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) varies with age. Clarification of the definition based on available evidence was an important objective of the 2015 ESC/ERS guideline. The new definition of PH is a resting mPAP >= 25 mm Hg. Further studies are needed to better determine the natural history of patients with mPAP 21 to 24 mm Hg. The exercise and PVR criteria should be eliminated. A resting mPAP of 8 to 20 mm Hg should be considered normal, based on available evidence.
C1964000	Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an immune-mediated, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP). Condition commonly follows a viral or mycoplasmal illness affecting the upper respiratory or alimentary tracts. Other antecedent events include certain vaccinations. Immune responses directed toward the infecting organisms likely cross-react with neural tissues including Schwann cell surface membrane (resulting in AIDP) or axonal membrane (acute axonal forms). GBS is usually characterized by: weakness or paralysis affecting more than one limb, usually symmetrically; loss of tendon reflexes; and increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein without pleocytosis. Other features may include: motor and sensory involvement; facial or cranial nerve involvement; and electrophysiologic evidence of demyelination. Acute form of GBS has a typically rapid evolution from hours to days, usually reaching maximum level of weakness within four weeks. Condition is classified as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) if patient's symptoms continue to progress beyond 4 weeks, or relapses occur. Peak disability in CIDP usually occurs in two months.
C1964001	Encephalitis is defined as inflammation of the brain. Commonly has an infectious etiology. May also be drug-induced (focus of this SMQ). Mixed disorders such as encephalomyelitis, encephalomyeloradiculitis, or encephalo-myelopathy may present with overlapping symptoms. Signs and symptoms include: acute febrile illness characteristic of meningitis; confusion; behavioral abnormalities, including frank psychosis; altered level of consciousness; focal or generalized seizures; and focal neurological disturbances including aphasia, ataxia, hemiparesis, involuntary movements, cranial nerve deficits. Involvement of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis may result in temperature dysregulation, diabetes insipidus, or development of SIADH. Characteristic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile consists of lymphocytic pleocytosis, mildly elevated protein concentration and normal glucose concentration. MRI, CT, and EEG abnormalities may occur.
C1964002	Encephalopathy and delirium commonly have infectious or metabolic etiologies. May also be drug-induced (focus of this SMQ). In the case of metabolic disorders, it is possible that drug plays a contributory or causative role for underlying metabolic abnormality. Encephalopathy and delirium may be reported synonymously; however delirium may be narrower in scope. 1) Encephalopathy: Defined as any degenerative or diffuse disease of the brain that alters brain structure or function. Many sub-forms including: biliary; demyelinating; Wernicke's; secondary to infections; and secondary to drug-induced metabolic disorders such as hepatic encephalopathy, hyperammonemia, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, uremia. Leukoencephalopathy (encephalopathy with white matter lesions) may be secondary to drug-induced hypertension. Hallmark is altered mental state. Other symptoms include lethargy, fluctuation of level of consciousness, nystagmus, tremor, dementia, seizures, myoclonus, and muscle weakness. Cerebral edema is common. 2) Delirium (Acute confusional state): Delirium is a clinical state characterized by fluctuating disturbances in cognition, mood, attention, arousal, and self-awareness. May be due to primary brain diseases or secondary to other diseases. Causes include: metabolic; toxic (drugs); structural (vascular occlusion and cerebral infarction); intracerebral hemorrhage; primary or metastatic brain tumors; and infections. Signs and symptoms include clouding of consciousness with disorientation, changes in personality and mood, delusions, hallucinations (commonly visual), paranoia, withdrawal, agitation, disordered speech.
C1964003	Meningitis is defined as an inflammation of the meninges. Commonly has an infectious etiology. May also be drug-induced (focus of this SMQ). 1) Aseptic meningitis: Characterized by CSF mononuclear pleocytosis and an absence of bacteria on examination and culture. May be caused by viruses. Rare but well-recognized complication of drug therapy. Drug-induced aseptic meningitis (DIAM) has distinct presentation with fever, neck stiffness, headache, confusion, nausea and vomiting. Major categories of causative agents are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antimicrobials, intravenous immunoglobulins, monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. 2) Chronic meningitis: Meningeal inflammation lasting more than one month. Causative agents include chemotherapy drugs that are injected directly into the CSF (e.g., methotrexate), drugs used in organ transplantation (e.g., cyclosporine and OKT3) and even NSAIDs. Symptoms similar to those of acute bacterial meningitis, but develop more slowly and gradually; fever often less severe. Include headache, confusion, backache, weakness, numbness, and facial paralysis. Mixed disorders such as encephalomyelitis, encephalomyeloradiculitis, or encephalo-myelopathy may present with overlapping symptoms.
C1964004	Accidents and injuries have been associated with use of medications, particularly older psychotropic medications, and especially patients with pre-existing high risk levels and/or continuing mental problems. In a study of falls in elderly, use of certain drugs (benzodiazepines, phenothiazines, and antidepressants) was an independent risk factor. Study on risk of accidental injury and benzodiazepines also confirmed an increased risk, especially in patients who had recently filled their prescription. Accident is defined as an unplanned or unintended but sometimes predictable event leading to injury, e.g., in traffic, industry, or a domestic setting, or such an event developing in the course of a disease. In medicine, the term injury can have a very broad meaning. For the purpose of this SMQ, a more narrow definition is used, i.e., to injure is to wound, hurt or harm. Focus of this SMQ is not on metabolic injury (toxicity, etc.), but on personal injury or accident to the individual as a result of altered perception, consciousness, attention, behavior, etc.
C1964005	Extravasation of drug product administered by venous access is a local complication and can be associated with pain and swelling. Some products may be associated with more serious sequelae including tissues necrosis. May be caused by: damage to the posterior wall of the vein or occlusion of the vein proximal to the injection site; occlusion of vein proximal to injection site. Extravasation is broadly defined as discharge or escape of blood or other fluid normally found in a vessel or tube, into the surrounding tissues. For purposes of this SMQ, extravasation relates to complication of drug delivery (injection, infusion, etc.) or to a device (includes potential sequelae of extravasation). Pain, erythema, and swelling are typically observed.

C1964010	Hyponatremia has occurred with a variety of medical conditions: adrenal insufficiency, congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, nephritic syndrome, hypothyroidism, psychogenic polydipsia, hyperglycemia, acute or chronic renal failure, vomiting, diarrhea and SIADH. It can be: hypovolemic, i.e., associated with sodium and water depletion; hypervolemic, i.e., associated with fluid overload and edema; or isovolemic, i.e., associated with normal or modest extracellular volume expansion. SIADH occurs with a variety of medical conditions: neoplasms (particularly carcinomas), CNS disorders (stroke, intracranial hemorrhage or hematoma, encephalitis or meningitis, or acute psychosis), or pulmonary disorders (pneumonia, tuberculosis, asthma, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Hyponatremia and SIADH are associated with drugs such as CNS active drugs (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen, thiazide diuretics and furosemide, sulfonylureas, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and many anti-neoplastic agents. Hyponatremia usually defined as serum sodium < 135 mEq/L. If severe (serum sodium<120 mEq/L) or rapid, presenting signs and symptoms are suggestive of water intoxication. Cerebral edema symptoms: headache, mental confusion, disorientation, encephalopathy, tremors, gait disturbances, convulsions, and coma. Other symptoms: nausea, vomiting, and muscle weakness or cramps. Other laboratory abnormalities: decreased plasma osmolality, increased or decreased urine osmolality, and increased or decreased urine sodium concentration.
C1964011	Aggression: a form of behavior which leads to self-assertion; it may arise from innate drives and/or a response to frustration; it may be manifested by destructive and attacking behavior, by covert attitudes of hostility and obstructionism, or by a healthy self-expressive drive to mastery. Hostility: a tendency to feel anger toward and to seek to inflict harm upon a person or group.
C2242744	Ischaemic colitis is injury of large intestine that results from interruption of its blood supply. Caused by transient reduction in blood flow to colon. Most patients are elderly, but also occurs in younger ages associated with oral contraceptive use, vasculitis, hypercoagulable states. Clinical picture depends on degree and rate of development of ischemia. Acute fulminant ischaemic colitis: severe lower abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, and hypotension; dilatation of colon (severe cases); signs of peritonitis (severe cases). Subacute ischaemic colitis: most common clinical variant; produces lesser degrees of pain and bleeding (occurring over several days or weeks). Ischemic colitis is second most common cause of lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Diagnosis made by colonoscopy. Usually develops in absence of major vessel occlusion. Associated factors: decreased cardiac output; arrhythmia; trauma; surgery (e.g., aorto-iliac surgery); vasculitis; coagulation disorders; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; irritable bowel syndrome; specific drugs. More than two thirds of patients respond to conservative measures (IV fluids, bowel rest, antibiotics). Surgery rarely required
C2242745	Drug-induced edema has been described for a number of medications. Mechanisms: Enhanced sodium and water reabsorption by kidneys; potent vasodilators and calcium channel blockers (cause capillary leakage); non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit renal prostaglandin synthesis. Other drug products associated with peripheral edema: Antidepressants, estrogens, corticosteroids, COX-2 inhibitors. Edema definition: presence of abnormally large amounts of fluid in intercellular tissue spaces. Usually refers to demonstrable amounts of fluid in subcutaneous tissues. May be localized (due to venous or lymphatic obstruction or increased vascular permeability) or systemic (due to heart failure or renal disease). Sometimes designated by other terms according to site (ascites, hydrothorax, or hydropericardium). Massive generalized edema is called anasarca. Synonyms: dropsy and hydrops. Effusion definition: escape of fluid from lymphatics or blood vessels into a cavity or tissues; results from altered hydrostatic forces
C2242746	Group of eye diseases characterized by increased intraocular pressure (IOP). Causes pathologic changes in optic disk and defects in field of vision. Two main types: 1. angle-closure glaucoma (drainage canals within eye physically blocked) - sub-types: acute: sudden increase in IOP due to buildup of aqueous humor; chronic: may cause vision damage without symptoms; 2. open-angle glaucoma: drainage system remains open; may cause vision damage without symptoms (most common form of glaucoma). Other types of glaucoma: normal (or low) tension glaucoma (optic nerve damage but IOP is normal); childhood glaucoma; congenital glaucoma; secondary glaucoma (due to structural problem of eye including injury or other conditions). Causes of glaucoma: some have mutation of GLC1A gene (chromosome 1; gene product may be involved in eye pressure regulation); increased risk with elevated IOP, family history, ethnic background (e.g., glaucoma leading to blindness occurs 6-8 times more often in African Americans and Alaska Natives than in whites), and older age; other factors may contribute as people with normal IOP can get vision loss from glaucoma; some with high IOP never develop optic nerve damage. Symptoms include peripheral vision loss, headaches, blurred or foggy vision, difficulty adapting to darkness, halos around lights, severe eye pain, facial pain, pupil non-reactive to light, eye redness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and bulging eye.
C2363982	Hypertension is defined as high arterial blood pressure. Causes are either unknown (essential or idiopathic hypertension) or associated with other primary diseases (secondary hypertension). Various criteria for its threshold range from 140 mm Hg systolic and 90 mm Hg diastolic to 200 mm Hg systolic and 110 mm Hg diastolic. Per 2003 ESH/ESC Hypertension Guidelines and NHLBI, optimal blood pressure is less than 120/80 mm Hg. Prehypertension is defined as blood pressure120-139/80-89 mm Hg. Newer definitions characterize hypertension as a complex progressive cardiovascular syndrome. The majority of patients are asymptomatic; hypertension is only identified by measuring blood pressure. Signs and symptoms include headache (only in severe hypertension); and other possibly related complaints: dizziness, flushed face, early fatigability, palpitation, and nervousness. Complaints referable to vascular effects include epistaxis, hematuria and blurring of vision. Common presentations of hypertensive emergencies are chest pain, dyspnoea, and neurologic deficit. Neurologic presentations include occipital headache, cerebral infarction or hemorrhage, visual disturbance, or hypertensive encephalopathy. No early pathological changes occur in primary hypertension. Ultimately, generalized arteriolar sclerosis develops, particularly in the kidneys. Hypertension is an important risk factor for cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Early diagnosis and treatment is essential.
C2363983	Optic nerve transmits impulses generated by retinal photoreceptors to the brain. Damage anywhere along the optic nerve or to visual areas of brain can result in loss of vision. No overall definition for optic nerve disorders; SMQ focuses on optic neuropathy, optic neuritis (inflammation), and papilledema (swelling of optic nerve). Causes of optic neuropathy: toxins, including lead, methanol, ethylene glycol, tobacco or arsenic; compromised blood supply; nutritional deficiencies, especially vitamin B12; drugs, including chloramphenicol, isoniazid, ethambutol or digoxin. Loss of vision may be rapid (minutes or hours) or gradual over 2-7 days. One or both eyes can be affected, depending on cause. Vision can range from almost normal to complete blindness. Both eyes usually affected in optic neuropathy due to toxins or nutritional deficiency. Small area of vision loss at center of visual field slowly enlarges and can progress to complete blindness.

C2363989	Demyelination: loss of myelin with preservation of the axons or fiber tracts. Group of diseases of nervous system with damage and destruction of myelin sheaths surrounding nerve fibers. Axons may be damaged as well. Mechanism of myelin damage may be different in various diseases. Impairs conduction of signals in affected nerves. Causes impairment in sensation, movement, cognition, or other functions. Most common demyelinating disease is multiple sclerosis. Other examples include central pontine myelinolysis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord. Central demyelination occurs within central nervous system (e.g., multiple sclerosis). Peripheral demyelination affects peripheral nervous system (e.g., Guillain-Barre syndrome). Other causes: genetic, autoimmune reaction, immunological disorders, nutritional or metabolic disorder, toxins (including some used in therapy such as anti-mitotic agents and radiotherapy), unknown.
C2363990	Most common cause of reduced vision (particularly cataracts). Responsible for about 35% of cases of visual impairment. Cataracts: may result from a number of processes (mainly age-related); usually progress slowly, but frequently only detected when reach a certain level of severity, or during opthalmological examination; symptoms often subtle (e.g., yellow vision) and often an anatomically severe cataract will not be associated with an equally severe functional loss of vision; symptoms may include glare, blurred vision, altered color perception, change of refraction, and monocular diplopia. A sudden appearance reported as an adverse event could actually result from a pre-existing condition. Care should be taken in evaluating apparent association between these lesions and drug therapy. Definitions (from multiple sources): Aphakia: absence of lens; may occur congenitally or from trauma, but is most commonly caused by extraction of a cataract; cataract: congenital or acquired lack of clarity of the lens; clouding of the lens; opacity of lens or capsule of eye causing impairment of vision or blindness.

C2609419	Eosinophilic pneumonias are characterized by accumulation of eosinophils in alveolar spaces, interstitium, or both. Peripheral eosinophilia is common. Causes include: infections (especially helminthic); drug-induced pneumonitis (e.g., antibiotics, phenytoin, l-tryptophan); inhaled toxins (e.g., cocaine); systemic disease (e.g., Churg Strauss syndrome); allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Diagnosis based on opacities on chest X-ray and eosinophilia in peripheral blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or lung biopsy. Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia has unknown etiology. Suspected to be allergic diathesis. Fulminant illness with cough, fever, weight loss, accompanied by or preceded by asthma in 50% of cases. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia also has unknown etiology but may be acute hypersensitivity reaction to unidentified inhaled antigen. Characterized by acute febrile illness with cough, dyspnea, malaise, myalgias, night sweats, and pleuritic chest pain. Loeffler's syndrome may be caused by parasitic infections, especially Ascaris lumbricoides, but identifiable agent often not found. Characterized by absent or mild respiratory symptoms, fleeting migratory pulmonary opacities, and peripheral blood eosinophilia.
C2609420	Retinal disorders are manifested by a variety of signs and symptoms; no overall definition possible. SMQ focuses on retinal disorders with damage of retina due to blockage of its blood supply, nutritional deficiencies, toxins, and diseases affecting retina.
C2609421	Thyroid dysfunction can present as hypo- or hyperactive thyroidal function. Hypothyroidism is thyroid hormone deficiency. Primary hypothyroidism is due to thyroid disease; TSH is increased. Most common cause is autoimmune. Other common causes are post-therapeutic, occurring after radioactive iodine therapy, surgery, radiation, or lithium therapy. Secondary hypothyroidism occurs when hypothalamus produces insufficient TRH or pituitary produces insufficient TSH. Signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism include: cold intolerance, constipation, personality changes, dementia or frank psychosis, hoarse voice, facial puffiness, coarse hair and skin, fluid retention, decreased metabolism, paresthesias, decreased libido, menstrual irregularities, bradycardia, pericardial effusions. Hyperthyroidism is excessive production of iodinated thyroid hormones, T3 and T4. Graves' disease (toxic diffuse goiter) is most common cause and is characterized by hyperthyroidism, goiter, exophthalmos, pretibial myxedema. Inflammatory thyroid disease (thyroiditis) includes subacute granulomatous thyroiditis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and silent lymphocytic thyroiditis. Drug-induced hyperthyroidism can result from lithium or interferon-alpha. Signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism include: hyperactivity, increased sweating, increased appetite, weight loss, insomnia, weakness, frequent bowel movements, hypomenorrhea, tremor; tachycardia, atrial fibrillation. Eye signs include stare and eyelid retraction. Infiltrative ophthalmopathy is specific to Graves' disease.

C2609432	SMQ is intended to include ear disorders that may be drug related. Two sub-search SMQs created for two functions of ear: Hearing impairment (SMQ); and Vestibular disorders (SMQ).
C2609433	SMQ is intended to include ear disorders that may be drug related. Two sub-search SMQs created for two functions of ear: hearing and balance. Hearing may be impaired, disturbed, or accentuated. Hearing loss and abnormal hearing are not separated in this SMQ due to overlap of the these conditions in certain patients. Definition: hearing - ability to perceive sound; sensation of sound as apposed to vibration. Hearing impairment may result from: a lesion in external auditory canal or middle ear (conductive hearing loss); or a lesion in inner ear or VIIIth cranial nerve (sensorineural). Sensorineural hearing loss can be further differentiated as: sensory (cochlea); or neural (VIIIth cranial nerve)
C2609434	SMQ is intended to include ear disorders that may be drug related. Two sub-search SMQs created for two functions of ear: hearing and balance. In this SMQ, included terms are for vestibular disorders generally that originate from inner ear. Definition: vestibular - related to vestibule of ear.

Other effects on person's day-to-day functioning, ability to work, relationships with family and friends, and quality of life.
C2609435	SMQ developed to detect all types of malignant and unspecified tumors related to the skin. It covers all types of malignant and unspecified neoplasms related to skin; also: malignancy related conditions (specific for skin); malignancy related therapeutic procedures (specific for skin); malignancy related diagnostic procedures (specific for skin). Includes two sub-search SMQs - one for malignant tumors and one for tumors of unspecified malignancy.
C2609436	Vasculitis: inflammation of blood vessel walls. Clinical and pathological features vary depending on site and type of blood vessels affected. Primary vasculitis: vasculitis is the primary process. Examples are: temporal arteritis, polyarteritis nodosa, and Wegener's granulomatosis. Vasculitis can be a secondary feature as with systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. Vasculitis is characterized by inflammation of and damage to blood vessels. Vessel lumen is usually compromised. Vasculitis is associated with ischemia of tissues supplied by the involved vessel. A broad and heterogeneous group of syndromes may result from this process. Any type, size, and location of blood vessel may be involved and may be confined to a single organ, such as skin, or may simultaneously involve several organ systems.
C2721744	Conjunctiva is mucous membrane investing anterior surface of eye (bulbar conjunctiva) and posterior surface of eyelids (palpebral conjunctiva). Disorders that affect conjunctiva include: acute conjunctivitis (viral, bacterial, inclusion, seasonal/allergic); chronic conjunctivitis (trachoma, perennial allergic, vernal keratoconjunctivitis); trauma (subconjunctival hemorrhage, foreign bodies, lacerations); degenerative conditions (Cogan's senile plaque, pinguecula, pterygium, concretions, retention cysts); blistering mucocutaneous diseases (cicatrical pemphigoid, Stevens-Johnson syndrome); pigmented lesions; and tumors. [Note that the exclusion criteria for this SMQ excludes terms for known causes of or syndromes associated with conjunctival disorders (e.g., PT Pemphigoid). Symptoms vary according to underlying problem. Some common features are: complaints of a red eye; epiphora (excess tears); irritation, such as a foreign body sensation, due to presence of follicles or papillae; itching - hallmark of allergic conjunctivitis but may also occur in blepharitis or keratoconjunctivitis sicca; pain - generally mild (in absence of trauma, significant pain is unusual); and complaints of a discharge.
C2721745	Disorders that affect lacrimal gland and drainage system include: secretory dysfunction (lacrimal insufficiency); blockage of nasolacrimal duct; occlusion/stenosis of punctum; lacrimal gland neoplasms; and inflammations and infections. Clinical manifestations include: excessive tear production; dry eyes. Causes include: systemic diseases, e.g., rheumatoid arthritis; drugs (e.g., diuretics) which may also exacerbate symptoms of a dry eye.
C2721746	HIV associated lipodystrophy: abnormal central fat accumulation (lipohypertrophy) and localized loss of fat tissue (lipoatrophy). Some patients have only lipohypertrophy or only lipoatrophy; others have a mixed clinical presentation. Lipohypertrophy and lipoatrophy are distinct entities with different risk factors and underlying metabolic processes. Lipohypertrophy: enlarged dorsocervical fat pad; circumferential expansion of neck; breast enlargement (including gynecomastia); abdominal visceral fat accumulation and other new fat accumulations that are circumscribed (e.g., lipomas) or general. Lipoatrophy: peripheral fat wasting; loss of subcutaneous tissue in face, arms, legs, buttocks; involvement of face is most common. Additional features: hyperlipidemia; insulin resistance; hyperinsulinemia; hyperglycemia; low levels of high density lipoprotein; and increased risk of diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis. Mechanisms for development are not completely understood. HIV-1 protease inhibitor drugs and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors are implicated as follows: decreased production of retinoic acid and triglyceride uptake; inhibition of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymerase gamma; inhibition of lipid metabolism; and prevention of development of adipocytes. Evidence suggests decreased insulin sensitivity, beta-cell dysfunction, and down-regulated estrogen receptor expression in adipose tissue. In absence of HAART, HIV-1 may itself cause dyslipidemia and lipodystrophy by various mechanisms. Resting energy expenditure and lipid oxidation are higher in HAART-treated HIV-positive patients with vs. without lipodystrophy.
C2721747	Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disorder characterized by: decreased bone mass and deterioration of bone microarchitecture. Osteopenia is a milder form of bone loss. Increased fracture risk even with minimal trauma; most common sites for bone loss and resultant fractures are thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, ribs, upper femur, lower radius. Usually causes no signs or symptoms except height loss and kyphosis until fractures occur. Pathogenesis: genetics; medications; diet; race; gender; lifestyle; physical activity. Type 1 (postmenopausal) is most common; results from sex hormone deficiency; increased recruitment/responsiveness of osteoclast precursors and increased bone resorption outpace bone formation; decreased trabecular bone leads to an increased risk of Colles and vertebral fractures; estrogen deficiency may cause bone to be more sensitive to parathyroid hormone, leading to increased calcium release from bone, decreased renal calcium excretion, and increased production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D; gonadal deficiency may also increase production of cytokines that have an influence on osteoclasts. Type 2 (senile) occurs in both genders; decreased formation of bone and decreased renal production of 1,25(OH)2 D3 occurring late in life; loss of cortical and trabecular bone leads to increased fracture risk in hip, long bones, vertebrae. Type 3, secondary to medications or due to other conditions that cause increased bone loss by various mechanisms. Bone mineral density frequently used as approximate measure of bone strength. WHO defines osteoporosis as bone density 2.5 standard deviations below mean for young adult white females. Markers of bone turnover (bone specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, type I procollagen peptides, and urinary deoxypyridinoline) sometimes used to monitor response to therapy
C2721748	Eyelids maintain health of underlying eye by protecting cornea and assist in distribution and elimination of tears. Eyelid structure: anterior layer of skin and orbicularis oculi muscle; posterior layer of tarsus and conjunctiva; orbicularis oculi muscles (innervated by CN VII) closes eyelid; upper eyelid is raised by levator muscle (innervated by CN III) and Mueller's muscle; orbital septum - originating from orbital rim - inserts into upper lid and lower lid; septum limits spread of eyelid bleeding or infection to posterior orbital structures. Glands along eyelid margin contribute to lipid component of tears; may become inflamed; meibomian glands lie within tarsus; pilosebaceous glands of Zeiss and apocrine glands of Moll are anterior to meibomian glands within distal eyelid margin. Problems that can afflict eyelids: neoplasms; inflammation and infection; and structural problems (e.g., ectropion). Most eyelid disorders do not threaten vision but may produce irritative symptoms (burning, foreign body sensation or pain). Blepharitis (eyelid inflammation) is characterized by erythematous eyelids with debris accumulation along eyelid margin.
C2748382	Osteonecrosis occurs as a result of compromise to the blood supply to bone. Hip (femoral head) is a common location, but other bones can also be affected. Two main forms: traumatic (more common, due to direct injury and damage of blood supply) and non-traumatic. Non-traumatic form is associated with several risk factors/conditions including corticosteroid use, alcohol abuse, sickle cell anemia, Gaucher disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, coagulopathies, hyperlipidemia, organ transplantation, caisson disease, thyroid disorders and genetic factors; some cases are idiopathic.Symptoms of osteonecrosis of the femoral head: groin pain (occasionally buttock pain; deep, throbbing and worsens upon walking); and catching or popping sensation with motion. Physical examination: pain with range of motion and walking; limitation of internal rotation; Trendelenburg gait often present; plain radiographs of hip are often normal. Osteonecrosis of jaw (ONJ): associated with use of biphosphonates; typically occurs in the setting of recent dental surgery; signs and symptoms include pain, tooth mobility, mucosal swelling, erythema and ulceration.
C2748383	Renovascular disorders include: atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (most common primary disease of the renal arteries); fibromuscular dysplasia of the renal arteries; embolic renal artery occlusion; and renovascular microvascular disorders. All can result in renal dysfunction, usually evidenced by high plasma renin levels. Usually present in one of three forms: asymptomatic renal artery stenosis; renovascular hypertension; ischemic nephropathy. Primarily due to constriction of afferent renal artery resulting in decreased perfusion pressure of larger circulation and/or microcirculation. Disorder of larger circulation is commonly due to unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis. Microcirculation disorders are commonly due to small vessel thrombosis from proximal upstream thrombi (e.g., in the stenosed renal artery) or from distal sites (e.g., intracardiac thrombi). Mechanisms of chemotherapy-induced renal dysfunction include: damage to kidney vasculature or structures; hemolytic uremic syndrome; prerenal perfusion deficits. Renovascular disorders may result in progressive severe hypertension with the usual sequelae of this condition.
C2748384	Sclera is the dense, white fibrous outer protective layer of eye. Consists largely of collagen. Histologic structure is similar to cornea. Varies in thickness from 0.3 mm to about 0.6 mm. Continuous with cornea (anterior) and dural sheath of optic nerve (posterior). Episclera is thin layer of elastic tissue on outer surface of anterior sclera; contains blood vessels that feed sclera. Signs and symptoms of sclera disorders are lacrimation, hyperemic patches, globe perforation, discoloration, plaque deposits, redness, eye pain, photophobia and loss of vision. Conditions affecting sclera include blue sclera, scleral ectasia, staphyloma, scleritis and episcleritis, scleromalacia perforans and hyaline degeneration.
C2939108	Three main forms: affecting the cornea and conjunctiva; endophthalmitis (infection inside the eye); infections of the ocular adnexa and orbit. Treatment of eye infections is based on severity of symptoms and magnitude of possible outcome. Severe conjunctivitis requires aggressive management with broad spectrum antibiotics. Vision loss can occur despite treatment. Patients who have had recent surgery are at risk for developing endophthalmitis. Numerous bacterial and fungal organisms can cause ocular infections.
C2939109	Ocular motility disorders include gaze palsy, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, oculomotor nerve lesions, trochlear nerve lesions, abducens nerve lesions, diabetic ophthalmoplegias, painful ophthalmoplegias, myesthenia gravis, and ocular myopathies. Extraocular muscles controlling eye movements are medial and lateral rectus, inferior and superior rectus, and superior and inferior oblique. Cranial nerve palsies resulting in eye movement disorders are: Oculomotor nerve palsy - may be caused by brain injury, aneurysm, hemorrhage, tumor, or diabetes; affected eye turns outward when the unaffected eye looks straight ahead; this causes double vision. Trochlear nerve palsy - often has no identified cause but may be due to head injury; both eyes or only one may be affected; affected eye is not able to turn inward or down; double vision results. Abducens nerve palsy - may have a number of causes including head injury, tumors, multiple sclerosis, aneurysms, CNS infection, etc.; affected eye cannot turn outward.

C3203746	Infertility: Failure to conceive (regardless of cause) after 1 year of unprotected intercourse. Up to 15% of couples of reproductive age are affected. Trend by many women to delay child-bearing is also a factor. Both male and female factors are involved in infertility, each gender accounting for approximately 35% of cases: combination of male and female factors accounts for 20% of infertility cases; in remaining 10%, etiology is not known. Some couples have normal results of standard infertility tests for infertility; postulated etiologies are: dysfunctional interaction between sperm and oocyte; poor quality of embryo; disruption at implantation site. Identifying a mutation or absence of a specific gene as reason for infertility may be possible in the future. Certain lifestyle factors have been linked to risk of infertility: environmental and occupational factors; toxic effects related to tobacco, marijuana, or other drugs; excessive exercise; inadequate diet associated with extreme weight loss or gain; advanced age. Drugs associated with development of infertility are: antineoplastic therapies (cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, etc.); combinations of antineoplastic agents and steroid drugs; certain antibiotics; thyroid supplements; others.
C3203747	Hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode (HHE) is characterized by:sudden onset of reduced muscle tone; hyporesponsiveness (to verbal or other stimuli)' changed skin color (pallor, cyanosis). HHE has occurred after immunization with the following vaccines: diphtheria; tetanus; Haemophilus influenzae type b; hepatitis B vaccines. Most reports followed administration of pertussis component vaccines. More often associated with: whole-cell vaccines than acellular types; during primary immunization, generally following the first dose. Unclear if observed phenomena are related to: characteristics of the vaccine; immunologic phenomenon; toxic component(s) in the vaccine; combination of factors. In US vaccine surveillance system (VAERS), slightly more females (53%) than males experienced HHE, however, more reports of HHE in males have been noted in the Netherlands vaccine surveillance system. Time to onset of signs after immunization is generally three to four hours but can range from immediately to up to 48 hours post-immunization. Episode typically lasts six to thirty minutes. Up to one-third of cases also describe a fever. The Brighton Collaboration (BC) HHE Working Group - in developing a case definition for HHE - described diagnostic algorithms with three levels of certainty based on clinical observations at the time of the episode:
C3495945	SMQ for generalized convulsive seizure (GCS) developed to address the occurrence of this form of seizure as an adverse event following immunization (AEFI).

Generalized seizures are classified as: atonic; tonic; clonic; tonic-clonic; myoclonic; absence. Seizures are characterized by: sudden, involuntary muscular contractions; sensory disturbances; autonomic dysfunction; behavioral abnormalities; impairment or loss of consciousness. With GCS, patient becomes unconscious and has convulsions over whole body. Brighton Collaboration case definition of generalized convulsive seizure as AEFI describes the following levels of diagnostic certainty: Level 1 of diagnostic certainty - witnessed sudden loss of consciousness AND generalized, tonic, clonic, tonic-clonic, or atonic motor manifestations; Level 2 of diagnostic certainty - history of unconsciousness AND generalized, tonic, clonic, tonic-clonic, or atonic motor manifestations; Level 3 of diagnostic certainty - history of unconsciousness AND other generalized motor manifestations.

SMQ Biliary tract disorders covers specific disorders of the entire biliary tract.
C3544361	Lymphoma: a heterogeneous group of malignancies generally divided into non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin disease. NHL is about 85% of lymphomas. Median age at diagnosis is sixth decade. Some forms of NHL - such as Burkitt lymphoma and lymphoblastic lymphoma - occur in younger patients. Classified by several different systems (e.g., Working Formulation, REAL classification) based on morphology and clinical behavior. Variety of laboratory and imaging studies are used to evaluate and stage NHL. Treatment depends on stage, grade, type and various patient factors (symptoms, age, etc.). NHL may result from: chromosomal translocations; infections (Epstein-Barr virus [EBV] and hepatitis C virus); environmental factors (radiation exposure and chemotherapy); immunodeficiency states; and chronic inflammation. Clinical presentation depends on location of disease and biologic characteristics (e.g., low grade vs. high grade). Peripheral adenopathy and B symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss) are characteristic for some forms of NHL. Hodgkin lymphoma: has histologic findings, biologic behavior, and clinical characteristics distinct from NHL. Excisional lymph node biopsy generally recommended to establish diagnosis. Various imaging studies used to determine disease stage. Lymphadenopathy and constitutional B symptoms are characteristic. Treated with multiagent chemotherapy, plus or minus radiation therapy. Etiology of Hodgkin lymphoma has not been established. Certain infectious agents, e.g. EBV, may be involved. HIV infected patients have a higher incidence. Genetic predisposition may also play a role.
C3544362	Aim of this SMQ is to support database searches for potentially drug/vaccine related hypersensitivity/allergic reactions in connection with Risk Management Plans, PSUR and other surveillance activities; designed to retrieve all types of cases possibly related to hypersensitivity/ allergic reactions; SMQ is not intended to differentiate between different types of hypersensitivity reactions such as the Coombs classification. A number of SMQs for specific allergic conditions already exist (e.g. SMQ Anaphylactic reaction, SMQ Angioedema). Hypersensitivity is often used in a very general way to describe a large number of conditions related to an exaggerated response of the body to a foreign agent; a more restricted use is for allergic reactions of all types. Many terms included in SMQ Hypersensitivity do not permit differentiation between hypersensitivity/allergic reactions and other causes for the given event and therefore further analysis of cases retrieved by the SMQ is required.
C3544363	Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a heterogeneous group of disorders affecting kidney structure and function. Symptoms include: anorexia, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, dysgeusia, nocturia, lassitude, fatigue, pruritus, decreased mental acuity, muscle twitches and cramps, water retention, undernutrition, gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding, peripheral neuropathies, and seizures. Diagnosis is based on laboratory testing of renal function and sometimes renal biopsy. Treatment directed at the underlying condition but includes fluid and electrolyte management, erythropoietin for anemia, dialysis or transplantation. CKD may result from a number of causes including: vascular disease; primary and secondary glomerular diseases; tubulointerstitial disease; and urinary tract obstruction. Markers of kidney damage in addition to proteinuria include urine sediment abnormalities and abnormalities on imaging studies. Two major outcomes of CKD include: loss of kidney function leading to failure; and development of cardiovascular disease. High blood pressure is both a cause and a complication of CKD and is associated with a faster loss of kidney function and development of cardiovascular disease. Additional complications include: anemia; malnutrition; bone disease and disorders of calcium and phosphorus metabolism; and neuropathies. Criteria for CKD established by the National Kidney Foundation are: kidney damage for =3 months (structural or functional abnormalities) with or without decreased glomerular filtration rate manifested by either pathological abnormalities or markers of kidney damage (urine or blood abnormalities, or abnormalities in imaging tests); and glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73m2 for =3 months, with or without kidney damage.

C3666006	SMQ Arthritis intended to identify potential cases of arthritis and worsened arthritis that may be drug related. Arthritis is inflammation of one or more joints, resulting in: redness, warmth, pain, swelling, stiffness, limited movement. Numerous types of arthritis exist, including: osteoarthritis, infective arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, related autoimmune diseases. Pain caused by intra-articular disorders may be secondary to: inflammatory arthritis (e.g., infection, RA, crystal deposition); or noninflammatory process (e.g., osteoarthritis). Inflammatory arthritis may involve: peripheral joints only (e.g., hands, knees, feet); or both peripheral and axial joints (e.g., sacroiliac, apophyseal, discovertebral, costovertebral). Peripheral oligoarticular and polyarticular arthritis have specific likely causes such as: juvenile idiopathic arthritis, Lyme disease arthritis. Acute polyarticular arthritis: most often due to infection (usually viral), or flare of a rheumatic disease. Chronic polyarticular arthritis in adults: most often due to rheumatoid arthritis (inflammatory), or osteoarthritis (noninflammatory). Chronic polyarticular arthritis in children: most often due to juvenile idiopathic arthritis. In many patients, arthritis is often transient, resolving without diagnosis, or may not fulfill criteria for a defined rheumatic disease
C3666007	Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) = heterogeneous group of clonal disorders of hematopoiesis. Characterized by: hyper- or hypocellular bone marrow; abnormal cell morphology; abnormal maturation; peripheral blood cytopenias; ineffective blood cell production. All three myeloid cell lineages (erythrocytic, granulocytic, and megakaryocytic) may be involved. Considered a premalignant condition as some patients progress to AML. May present with: anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia. Diagnostic approach includes: complete blood count with differential, peripheral blood smear, bone marrow studies. Treatment: supportive, including transfusions; possible bone marrow stimulation; cytotoxic chemotherapy; bone marrow transplantation has a limited role. May be caused by exposure to: cytotoxic chemotherapy; radiation; viral infection; genotoxic chemicals (e.g., benzene). May also be no known exposure. Cytogenetics include: normal karyotype; balanced chromosomal abnormality and generation of fusion oncogenes; complex karyotypes. Primarily affects the elderly. French-American-British classification: refractory anemia (RA); RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS); RA with excess blasts (RAEB; 6-20% myeloblasts); RAEB in transition to AML (RAEB-T; 21-30% myeloblasts); chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. 2008 WHO classification: refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia; RARS; RAEB; refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia; MDS with isolated deletion of 5q; MDS, unclassifiable; childhood MDS
C3666008	SMQ Noninfectious diarrhoea is intended to retrieve cases that may be drug related including antibiotic associated diarrhea not caused by Clostridium difficile or other infectious pathogens. Diarrhea defined as: increased frequency of bowel movements (>3 in 24 hours); and/or decreased stool consistency; and/or increased stool weight (>200g in 24 hours). Common side effect of many classes of medications, accounting for a high percentage of all adverse drug effects. Hundreds of drugs have been implicated in causing diarrhea. Most frequent are: antibiotics; laxatives; antihypertensives; lactulose or sorbitol containing products; antineoplastics; antiretroviral drugs; magnesium containing compounds; antiarrhythmics; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; colchicines; antacids and acid-reducing agents; prostaglandin analogs; and many supplements. Mechanisms of noninfectious diarrhea: non-inflammatory (e.g., osmotic or secretory diarrhea); inflammatory (e.g., cytotoxic effects of agents leading to intestinal mucositis)
C3666009	Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS): caused by release of tumor cell contents either from spontaneous cell lysis or in response to therapy. Characteristic findings: hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia. Can lead to downstream effects: renal insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmia, seizures , death (due to multiorgan failure). Dying cells release cytokines which may cause a systemic inflammatory response syndrome and multiorgan failure. Occurs most frequently in patients with high grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma and acute leukemia. Other tumors can also be implicated. Patients at highest risk having pre-existing: chronic renal insufficiency, oliguria, dehydration, hypotension, acidic urine. Management directed toward, metabolic and renal complications through supportive care. Distinction between laboratory TLS and clinical TLS: laboratory TLS requires two or more of the following abnormalities within 3 days before and 7 days after starting therapy: hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia; clinical TLS occurs when laboratory TLS has been established and is also accompanied by: increased creatinine level, seizures, cardiac dysrhythmia, or death. Renal injury is an important aspect of the disorder; occurs when calcium phosphate, xanthine and uric acid precipitate in renal tubules leading to obstruction and inflammation.
C3854681	Proteinuria is the presence of an excess of serum proteins in the urine (>300 mg/24h). Isolated proteinuria is urinary protein without other symptoms or urinary abnormalities. In many renal disorders, proteinuria occurs with other urinary abnormalities (e.g., hematuria). The presence of protein in the urine is toxic to the kidneys and causes renal damage. Proteinuria caused by renal disorders usually is persistent (i.e., present on serial testing). The upper limit of normal urinary protein excretion is considered to be 150 mg/day, which can be measured in a 24-h urine collection or estimated by random urine protein/creatinine ratio (values > 45 mg/mmol are abnormal); for albumin it is about 30 mg/day. Albumin excretion between 30 and 300 mg/day (20 to 200 mcg/min) is considered microalbuminuria, and higher levels are considered macroalbuminuria. When in the nephrotic range, proteinuria can cause significant protein wasting. May be associated with foamy urine. Classification of proteinuria: Glomerular proteinuria; Tubular proteinuria; Overflow proteinuria; Functional proteinuria; Orthostatic proteinuria.
C3854682	Renal tubulointerstitial diseases is a group of kidney diseases, specifically involving the interstitium and tubules, that develop as a result of primary injury or inflammation and which progress to decreased renal function. The glomeruli may be affected only late in the disease course or not at all. Two classes of tubulointerstitial disease: 1. Acute tubulointerstitial disease: Develops over days to months; characterized by inflammatory infiltrate and edema that affect the renal interstitium; leads to acute renal insufficiency or failure; in severe cases can lead chronic renal failure and/or permanent renal injury; principal etiologies: infections; drugs. 2. Chronic tubulointerstitial disease: can gradually develop over years; involves interstitial infiltrate, fibrosis, tubular atrophy and dysfunction, and eventually renal dysfunction; interstitial inflammation and scarring of the renal parenchyma is associated with gross changes, including papillary blunting and marked calyceal deformities; can be detected by imaging; systemic insults, such as genetic disorders, hypertension, toxins, etc., feature symmetric and bilateral disease; other causes of chronic disease may result in unequal renal scarring, and may involve one or both kidneys; principal etiologies include: toxins; drugs; autoimmune, genetic, and neoplastic disorders; obstructive uropathy.
C3889105	Respiratory failure is a life-threatening impairment of oxygenation or carbon dioxide elimination that affects breathing function or the lungs themselves, and can result in failure of the lungs to function properly. Two main pathophysiological etiologies (may occur singly, or in combination): inadequate oxygenation (impaired gas exchange); inadequate carbon dioxide elimination (decreased ventilation resulting in a rise in PaCO2). Common precipitating conditions: acute exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; overdoses of drugs that suppress ventilatory drive; and conditions that cause respiratory muscle weakness (e.g., Guillain-Barre syndrome, myasthenia gravis, botulism). Typical signs and symptoms: dyspnea; tachypnea; use of accessory muscles of respiration; tachycardia; diaphoresis; cyanosis; altered consciousness; without treatment, eventually obtundation, respiratory arrest, and death. Diagnostic measures: patient observation and clinical evaluation; arterial blood gases; and chest x-ray. Treatment includes: correction of underlying cause; supplemental oxygen; control of secretions; and ventilatory assistance.
C3889106	Chronic tendinopathies and ligament disorders are pathologic conditions of tendons or ligaments, resulting mainly from repeated minor strain. Formerly called tendonitis or ligamentitis. Etiologic factors: degenerative processes are thought to be principal underlying pathology; repeated minor strain is considered to be main precipitating factor; drug-associated forms have been described; an understanding of the pathophysiology continues to evolve. Most commonly injured tendons and ligaments: supraspinatus tendon and long head of the biceps muscle; Medial and lateral extensors of the elbow; patellar tendon; Achilles tendon; posterior tibialis tendon. Intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors: overuse (sports activities, training errors, fatigue); cold environment during outdoor training; faulty footwear/equipment; drugs (e.g., fluoroquinolone antibiotics, oral contraceptives, injected corticosteroids and statins). Commonly described presenting symptoms: pain at the site of the affected tendon or ligament; morning stiffness, local tenderness, swelling and reduced articular range of motion. Therapeutic approaches include: exercise, shock wave therapy, growth factors, nitric oxide, sclerosant therapy, gene therapy, and tissue engineering.
C4087540	Medication errors are defined as any preventable events that may cause or lead to inappropriate medication use or patient harm while the medication is in the control of the health care professional, patient or consumer. Such events may be related to professional practice, health care products, procedures and systems, including prescribing, order communication, product labeling, packaging and nomenclature, compounding, dispensing, distribution, administration, education, monitoring and use. A medication error can ultimately result in an adverse drug reaction (medication error with an ADR) or may have no clinical consequences (medication error without an ADR). A medication error can also be intercepted prior to the patient's exposure to the error. A potential medication error is a scenario which does not involve an actual patient, and represents circumstances or information capable of leading to the occurrence of a medication error. Medication errors cause a large number of ADRs annually: create a major public-health burden representing 18.7-56% of all adverse drug events among hospital patients; may cause unintended harm; are considered preventable. Medication errors result from a variety of human (e.g., healthcare professional; care giver; patient) and product-related reasons, for example: miscommunication of drug orders due to poor handwriting; confusion between drugs with similar names; poor packaging design; confusion of dosing units; unclear instructions. Medication errors can have an impact on: patients; healthcare professionals; pharmaceutical manufacturers; regulatory agencies; health insurance providers; national patient safety organisations.
C4087541	Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a severe, potentially life-threatening, delayed-onset drug reaction characterized by skin eruption, fever, hematologic abnormalities (eosinophilia, atypical lymphocytes), lymphadenopathy, and internal organ involvement. Although initially reported with antiepileptic medications, the syndrome has also been reported with other medications. It is associated with a highly variable clinical presentation, with patients exhibiting a wide array of symptoms. As a result, there is a lack of standardization of both the diagnostic criteria and the nomenclature. DRESS is diagnosed on the basis of clinical presentation as described above. Diagnostic criteria of DRESS -- Cases that report: Onset of symptoms within three months of starting therapy with a drug, AND Evidence of involvement of the skin and/or an extracutaneous organ system, AND At least two of the following: Fever; Eosinophilia (and/or atypical lymphocytes); Lymphadenopathy. Cases are excluded that: Did not report a temporal relationship between suspect drug and reaction; note: this may include cases in which the multiple signs & symptoms associated with DRESS did not occur within one month of each other (e.g. skin eruption followed by lymphadenopathy and fever 6 months later); Did not meet the inclusion criteria above; Reported a condition listed in the differential diagnosis section, or cases that described another more likely diagnosis; Are categorized as toxic drug-induced exanthema. These include cases in which patients have an exanthem and fever, but other manifestations have not been detected because laboratory tests were either not performed or could not be done.
C4087542	Hypoglycemia is characterized by reduced plasma glucose to a level (usually less than 50 mg/dL) that may cause signs or symptoms (e.g., mental status changes). Hypoglycemia typically arises from abnormalities in the mechanisms involved in glucose homeostasis. For the diagnosis of hypoglycemia, the Whipple triad is generally observed as low blood sugar, presence of symptoms, and reversal of these symptoms when the blood sugar level is restored to normal. The true prevalence is 5-10% of patients who present with symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemic symptoms are related to sympathetic activation and brain dysfunction due to the decreased glucose levels. This results in sweating, palpitations, tremulousness, anxiety, and hunger. Reduction in cerebral glucose availability (neuroglycopenia) may cause confusion, difficulty with concentration, irritability, hallucinations, focal impairment, coma and eventually death. Various forms and causes of hypoglycemia include: Drugs - ethanol, haloperidol, pentamidine, quinine, salicylates, sulfonamides (sulfa drugs) and oral hypoglycemic agents have been associated with hypoglycemia as have numerous other drugs. Surreptitious sulfonylurea use/abuse - self-induced hypoglycemia that may be observed in healthcare workers or in relatives who care for diabetic family members. Exogenous insulin - for example, insulin-producing tumors of the pancreas (islet cell tumors), and non-beta-cell tumors. Reactive hypoglycemia - idiopathic, due to alimentary problems (e.g., patients with previous upper gastrointestinal surgery), or congenital enzyme deficiencies (e.g., hereditary fructose intolerance). Fasting hypoglycemia: Nesidioblastosis is a medical term for hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia attributed to excessive function of pancreatic beta cells with an abnormal microscopic appearance.

C4524253	Pneumonia is acute inflammation of the lungs caused by infection; is the most common fatal hospital-acquired infection and the most common overall cause of death in developing countries. Two to three million people in the U.S. develop pneumonia per year; about 60,000 die. Diagnosis and management depend on whether infection is bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic; whether acquired in the community, hospital, or other health-care-associated location; and whether develops in a patient who is immunocompetent or immunocompromised. Clinical manifestations vary: from indolent to fulminant in presentation; from mild to fatal in severity; patient may be febrile with tachycardia, or may have history of chills and/or sweats; nonproductive or productive cough; pleuritic chest pain may occur; other symptoms may include fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, and gastrointestinal symptoms; complications of severe pneumonia include respiratory failure, septic shock and multiorgan failure, coagulopathy, and exacerbation of comorbid illnesses; may not be obvious in the elderly, who may initially display new-onset or worsening confusion with few other manifestations. Diagnostic modalities: chest x-ray; clinical signs; Gram's stain and culture of sputum; blood culture; urinary antigen tests for pneumococcal and legionella antigens; polymerase chain reaction tests for respiratory viral infection; specific IgM antibody titers; biomarkers. Treatment: antimicrobial agents and supportive measures.
C4552564	Dehydration is a deficiency of body water caused by inadequate intake of water or, more commonly, loss of water and sodium by the kidneys, gastrointestinal tract or skin. Water depletion may affect extracellular or intracellular volume, or both. Dehydration results from abnormal water intake (hypothalamic malfunction) or renal water wasting (diabetes insipidus). Hypernatraemia (Na > 145 mmol/l) is common. When both water and sodium are depleted, tachycardia, hypotension, and weight loss are common. Clinical findings vary based on the severity of the dehydration. In mild dehydration, the patient is alert, has capillary refill of 2 seconds or less and normal mucous membranes, tears, respirations, blood pressure, pulse and skin turgor. The eyes and fontanelles appear normal. Heart rate is slightly increased and urine output is decreased. In moderate dehydration, patients are lethargic, have capillary refill between 2 and 4 seconds, dry mucous membranes, decreased tears, increased respirations and heart rate, normal blood pressure (although orthostasis is present), thready pulse and skin turgor is slow to recover. Fontanelles can be depressed, eyes are sunken and oliguria is present. In severe dehydration, the patient is obtunded, has capillary refill over 4 seconds, cool extremities, parched or cracked mucous membranes, absent tears, increased respiratory rate, hyperpnea, tachycardia, decreased blood pressure, faint or impalpable pulse, and increased skin turgor with tenting. Fontanelles are sunken, eyes are very sunken and oliguria/anuria is present.
C4761275	Hypokalemia is a plasma potassium (K) concentration of less than 3.5 mEq/L caused by a deficit in total body potassium stores or abnormal movement of potassium into cells. It may be caused by a decreased intake of potassium or usually by excessive losses of potassium from the kidneys or from the gastrointestinal tract. Drugs known to cause hypokalemia include diuretics, laxatives, antimicrobials, mineralo -and glucocorticoids, and beta-2 receptor agonists. Clinical signs are dependent on the degree of potassium depletion and may include muscle weakness, muscle cramping, fasciculations, and paralytic ileus. Hypoventilation and hypotension occur when hypokalemia is severe. ECG changes typically occur when serum potassium is < 3 mEq/L, and include ST segment sagging, T wave depression, and U wave elevation. With marked hypokalemia, the T wave becomes progressively smaller and the U wave becomes increasingly larger. Hypokalemia may cause arrhythmias including premature ventricular and atrial contractions, ventricular and atrial tachyarrhythmias, and 2nd- or 3rd-degree atrioventricular block; eventually, ventricular fibrillation may occur. Treatment is with oral potassium replacement, giving 20 to 80 mEq/day unless patients have ECG changes or severe symptoms. For hypokalemic arrhythmias, intravenous potassium chloride is given through a central vein, at a maximum of 40 mEq/h and only with continuous cardiac monitoring; routine IV infusion should be no more than 10 mEq/h.
C5208327	Sepsis is life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis is caused by an infection of any organisms including bacterial, fungal and viral agents. In patients with an intact immune system, gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria are the most common cause. In patients with a compromised immune system, uncommon bacterial and fungal species are more commonly the cause. Many factors increase the risk of developing sepsis including indwelling vascular catheters or other invasive devices, recent surgical procedures, diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis, and compromised immune systems. Common sites of infection include the urinary, biliary, and gastrointestinal tracts as well as the lungs. Clinical signs are often non-specific but may include signs of infection including fever, tachycardia, and diaphoresis. As the condition deteriorates, signs and symptoms consistent with end-organ damage can present. Diagnosis of sepsis requires a combination of clinical signs and symptoms along with positive cultures of blood, urine or other sites of infection. Control of the infectious source should be undertaken promptly. All invasive devices should be removed or changed if possible; necrotic tissue and abscesses should be addressed. Treatment of sepsis centers on broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive treatment with vasopressors, IV fluids, oxygen, and corticosteroids. Patients with septic shock generally require intensive care. Blood sugar control is critical for patients with diabetes as hyperglycemia will impede the ability to respond adequately to the infection.
C5244072	Opportunistic infection is an infection by an organism that does not ordinarily cause disease in an individual with an intact immune system but becomes pathogenic in an immunocompromised host. While there is no clear definition of opportunistic infections widely accepted for all immunocompromised states, the common risk factor associated with opportunistic infection is a compromised immune function. Compromised immune function can be the result of a congenital or acquired immune deficiency, certain malignancies, cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunosuppressive therapy, biologic immune modulators, chronic medical conditions such as diabetes or cystic fibrosis, or mechanical damage to the skin or mucosa caused by inflammation (e.g., ulcerative colitis) or injury (e.g., severe burns). The etiologic agents leading to opportunistic infections may be different depending on the cause of the immunocompromise. The majority of serious infections occurring in this setting are similar to those seen in the general population, some infections are more likely to be associated with immunosuppression (or degree of immunosuppression), occur more severely in those who are immunosuppressed, or have important public health or clinical considerations (such as tuberculosis) that distinguish them those infections encountered in the general population. Opportunistic infections can be markers of specific types of immunosuppression and can serve as clinical indicators of specific underlying immune defects (e.g., Pneumocystis jirovecii and HIV).
C5400546	Immune-mediated disorders are characterized by immune dysregulation causing inflammation directed against the body's own tissues resulting in tissue damage. Autoimmune diseases specifically involve the development of immune hyperreactivity with autoantibodies and antigen-specific T cells targeting native antigens. Etiology of immune-mediated disorders is unclear but includes: genetic factors, infection, trauma, drugs affecting the immune system. Pathophysiology of immune-mediated inflammation may involve combinations of auto-reactive T cells, autoantibodies, inflammatory cytokines, complement activation. Not all immune-mediated disorders can be demonstrated to have a specific autoimmune mechanism. Cancer immunotherapy agents have been associated with immune-mediated adverse events that are inflammatory or autoimmune in nature. These may represent a de novo immune-mediated disorder or an exacerbation of a pre-existing condition. Immune-mediated disorders are also a potential concern for vaccines which use novel adjuvants to enhance the immune response. Toxicities are varied. Common events involve the skin, gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. Less common reactions include neurological events and endocrine dysfunction. Treatment of immunotherapy-mediated immune events includes corticosteroids and/or specific immunomodulatory agents.
C5400547	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Declared a pandemic by WHO in March 2020. Spread from person to person during close contact, mainly through respiratory droplets. Preventive strategies against spread include handwashing, wearing of masks, physical distancing, quarantine, patient isolation, and other infection control measures. Time from exposure to onset of symptoms ranges from 2-14 days. Majority of cases are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms but others develop severe or fatal infections. Common symptoms include: fever, cough, dyspnea, chills, myalgia, new loss of taste or smell. Severe clinical manifestations include: pneumonia, ARDS, multi-organ and systemic dysfunctions including cardiac injury, kidney injury, thromboembolic events, and inflammatory complications. Management focuses mainly on symptomatic treatment and supportive care. As of mid-2020, a variety of experimental treatments and vaccines are under investigation.
